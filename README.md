# Branching Model
-The master branch always reflects a production-ready state.
-The develop branch is the branch that we will work our new features/fixes and will always reflect the state with the latest delivered development changes for the next release.
-For any new feature/fix, we create a new branch (checkout from develop) for example "feature-fixESPLedBlinking".
-When we are ready we will merge our branch, for example "feature-fixESPLedBlinking", to our develop branch.
-Then we can merge our develop to our master branch.
